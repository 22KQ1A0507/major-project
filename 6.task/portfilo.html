        What is a residential building?
To be considered a residential building, a structure must provide more than fifty per cent of its total floor space to living quarters for its occupants. In other terms, a residential building is one that offers sleeping accommodations, either with or without a kitchen, dining, or combined dining and cooking capabilities.

 

Different types of residential buildings
There are many different types of residential buildings. These include:

 

Types of residential buildings #1: Single-family homes

Single-family houses are residences that are constructed on their own individual plots of land and do not share any walls with any other structures. Sometimes there will be a garage, either connected or separate. Single-family houses, in comparison to other housing options, often have more room, privacy, and outdoor space (in the form of front and rear yards). Since you aren’t required to worry about pleasing anybody else, you may build your house in whatever aesthetic you choose. There is a lot more upkeep for this type of residential building, and the expenditures are entirely on the homeowner. 

Condominiums are communities or complexes that consist of a collection of individual dwelling units. Condos often have shared walls with other units and are required to pay dues to homeowner’s organisations on a monthly or annual basis. These dues may be either monthly or yearly. They are common in densely populated urban areas that have a lot of shops, restaurants, and other enterprises.

The responsibility for care and maintenance that falls on the homeowner is quite little. In the event that your roof develops a leak, for instance, you may be able to divide the expense of repairing it with the other people who live in the building rather than paying for the complete replacement. In addition, some condominiums come equipped with luxuries and conveniences, such as fitness centres, social gathering spaces, swimming pools, and other facilities that are impossible to find in single-family homes or to fit into them.

You may be limited in the renovations you may make, as well as in your choice of pets and tenants, by your condo association’s rules.
